# Commissioning Bare Metal Example on WGM160P

This example is based on the [**Commissioning MicriumOS Example on WGM160P**](../../micrium_os/WGM160P/README.md) but without an Operating System.
The interface is very similar between the examples but consider executing the MicriumOS example and reading the associated documentation
as a first step before executing the Bare Metal example.
