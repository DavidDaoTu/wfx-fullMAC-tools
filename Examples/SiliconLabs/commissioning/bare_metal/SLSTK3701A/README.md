# Commissioning Bare Metal Example on EFM32GG11 (SLSTK3701A)

This example is based on the [**Commissioning MicriumOS Example on EFM32GG11 (SLSTK3701A)**](../../micrium_os/SLSTK3701A/README.md) but without an Operating System.
The interface is very similar between the examples but consider executing the MicriumOS example and reading the associated documentation
as a first step before executing the Bare Metal example.
