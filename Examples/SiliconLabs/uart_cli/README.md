# UART CLI Example

The purpose of this application is to provide a UART Command Line Interface (CLI) to allow interaction with part of the Wi-Fi FMAC driver and the LwIP APIs.

## Requirements

### Hardware Prerequisites

The example requires the hardware components below:

* [**EFM32 Giant Gecko GG11 Starter Kit (SLSTK3701A)**](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/mcu/32-bit/efm32-giant-gecko-gg11-starter-kit) with
  [**WF200 Wi-Fi速 Expansion Kit (SLEXP8022A)**](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/wireless/wi-fi/wf200-expansion-kit) or
  [**WFM200S Wi-Fi速 Expansion Kit (SLEXP8023A)**](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/wireless/wi-fi/wfm200-expansion-kit)
* [**WGM160P Wi-Fi速 Module Starter Kit**](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/wireless/wi-fi/wgm160p-wifi-module-starter-kit)
* A mini USB cable
* A PC is required to configure the board and it can also be used to load a binary file on the board, to compile the Simplicity Studio project or run a serial terminal

### Software Prerequisites

The required software includes:

* The example projects available in this repository
* A Serial terminal to communicate with the board. For example, [**Tera Term**](https://osdn.net/projects/ttssh2/releases/) or [**Putty**](https://www.putty.org/)
* Optionally [**Simplicity Studio 4**](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/simplicity-studio)

## Set up your Kit

Please follow the instructions related to the platform suiting your case:

* [**EFM32 Giant Gecko GG11 Starter Kit setup**](../shared/doc/slstk3701a/slstk3701a-setup.md)
* [**WGM160P Wi-Fi速 Module Starter Kit setup**](../shared/doc/wgm160p/wgm160p-setup.md)

## Start the Example

1. **Open a Serial Terminal** application, such as PuTTY, configure it to the COM Port Number you found in the previous step, and set the UART settings to **115200 bps, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit and no parity**.
2. Reset the board using the **'RESET' button**. You should see the following output.

		Type "help" to view a list of registered commands.
		@

3. The uart_cli project is ready to receive commands. You can start by the 'help' command to list available commands.
	The 'help' list below is provided as an indication. To access an up-to-date list, use the 'help' command on the target.
