WF200 Presentation {#mainpage}
============

The Silicon Labs WF200 is an **Ultra Low Power Wi-FiÂ® transceiver** or network co-processor (NCP) targeted for applications where optimal RF performance, low-power consumption, and secure end-to-end solution, together with fast time to market, are key requirements.
The WF200 integrates the Balun, T/R switch, LNA and PA for best possible RF performance. WF200 has been optimized for resource and power constrained devices at the RF, protocol
and firmware levels.

The Silicon Labs WF200 FMAC driver is a driver used as an interface for Silicon Labs WLAN WF200 parts and associated modules. 
The WF200 FMAC driver is a driver which enables communication with WF200 parts using the full MAC layer interface.
